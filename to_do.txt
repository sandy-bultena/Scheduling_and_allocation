============ Bugs ================
* Auto save
* Maybe Mac menu stuff (a nice to have)
* Windows, binding to ctrl-s isn't working properly
* working on allocation... opening new schedule once thing is open does not refresh properly

============ Done ================
* Switching between view tabs and back disconnects view from view controller (and the buttons I thing in the view choices)
* In Scheduler, the view is not updated when teacher is given release i.e. block is still coloured yellow
* In edit course window, only open tree element if user paused for more than '1/2' seconds
* when refreshing the gui-choices page in Scheduler, resources are not updated to reflect any changes
* when new schedule opened in scheduler, notebook pages are not updated
