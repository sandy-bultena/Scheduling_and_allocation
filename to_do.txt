============ Bugs ================
* Maybe Mac menu stuff (a nice to have)
* Windows, binding to ctrl-s isn't working properly
* Show teacher stat in scheduler
* Bind Scroll methods to mousewheel, etc for CourseTree

============ Done ================
* Switching between view tabs and back disconnects view from view controller (and the buttons I thing in the view choices)
* In Scheduler, the view is not updated when teacher is given release i.e. block is still coloured yellow
* In edit course window, only open tree element if user paused for more than '1/2' seconds
* when refreshing the gui-choices page in Scheduler, resources are not updated to reflect any changes
* when new schedule opened in scheduler, notebook pages are not updated
* working on allocation... opening new schedule once thing is open does not refresh properly
* Get preferences working for last directory where file was loaded
* Scheduler, opening new file gives empty "Scheduler" Tab
* Last fix broke something else
* add "teacher:" and "lab:" in front of resources in tree-view
* in edit block... if a teacher was already assigned to the block, was in neither list
* Edit class time pop-up doesn't work
* adding/removing teacher in tree_view should call schedule.conflicts so that "scheduler" page button colours work properly ... just needed to do a self.refresh()
* Auto save
* For schedule "validate", incorrect number of hours doesn't specify which section
* Put str(time_slot) to show start/duration rather than start/stop time
* If reading a schedule file fails, give better feedback
