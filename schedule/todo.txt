  longer close the dialog box

+ CSV hardening

(X) Can't close top level
(X) View scaling doesn't work properly
(X) Why did change to _get_canvas_coords break code
(X) Change colour coding

no longer relevant: In EditCourse, when adding sections, max is 10 (ok...?) 
  but when you do it again, the section numbers listed are still 1..10, 
  confusing because I didn't think it was working (it was... 
  but maybe numbers should be section numbers)

Olivia Testing

- make drag and drop functionality more obvious
- relabel blocks when you delete one out of the middle
- create way to add resource to a bunch of blocks at once
-fix label of max number of sections (should be 50, says 100)
- give user warning message if they try to add more than the max number of sections/blocks/hours/etc
-allow user to name sections during course creation?
-add limit to blocks/sections with new course menu
-in data entry, deleting all fields should delete resource/teacher
-in resource creation, if you fill out room/description fields with your mouse hovering outside the region and switch between them by hitting tab, then leave the resource tab without clicking on a field box, the resource is not created (tabbing should also create resource)
-deleting resources does not relabel ids, no new rooms with that id can be created
-empty name resources show up in the drag/drop menu but have no effect when dragged onto a section
