# SchedProg

A package of tools used for scheduling and allocating 
teachers and labs etc.



Uses Perl/Tk GUI 

Takes into account the following contraints
1. Teachers
2. Labs
3. Streams
4. Limits schedules based on current Collective Agreement Rules

Files are saved in YAML format, so they can be edited manually 
if  you are brave enough.
