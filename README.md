# Scheduling and Allocation Programs

## Description

A package of visual tools used for scheduling and allocating teachers and labs etc.

Create:
* Courses
  * Sections within Courses
    * Class Times

Allocate:
* Add teachers to individual sections in a spread-sheet like form
  * If the number of students is defined per section, the CI will be calculated for each teacher
  * Course/sections that do not have enough teachers allocated will be indicated, for easier assessment of the *correctness* of the allocation

Schedule:
* Assign class times to labs or rooms
* Change class times by dragging the time slot indicated around on individual views
  * A view is a visual representation of one of the following:
    * teacher view: all the class times that the teacher has been assigned
    * lab view: all the class times that a specific room has been allocated for the various courses
    * stream view: all the class times that a specific cohort of students have been assigned
* Changing a class time in one view will be reflected in all other open views
* If there is a conflict (time overlap) it will be indicated by colour coding the class time, in all views where this conflict affects a resource (lab/teacher/stream)


Specifically designed for the Quebec Cegep System
